            <h2>Who is Extremoduro?</h2>
            <p>
                Extremoduro are a Spanish hard rock band from Plasencia, Extremadura. The band is led by Roberto Iniesta, also known as "Robe", who is often referred as "El rey de Extremadura" (The king of Extremadura). The name Extremoduro is a pun on the band's home region in western Spain, Extremadura, and roughly translates as "extremely tough".
                <br><br>
                The band was created in 1987 and is regarded as one of the most influential bands of the Spanish hard rock scene, besides being a complete symbol for their region. Influenced by the Spanish literature, Iniesta's lyrics are often described as rude street poetry, with frequent allusions to drugs, sex and self-destruction.
                <br><br>
                Well-known songs by Extremoduro include "So payaso", "Golfa", "Salir", "Extremaydura", "Puta" and "Jesucristo García". The highest moment in the band's career was probably reached with the release of their album Agila, which was awarded a prize for best video in the first edition of the Spanish Music Awards in 1997.
                <br><br>
                It is considered one of the best Spanish bands ever by several music magazines. They were ranked number 6 on Rolling Stone's "50 Greatest Spanish rock bands".
